1. We would run it "Within a Github actions that runs whenever code is pushed" since we want to continuously check our code to make sure that it is working and following the best coding practices. This way we can catch errors/bugs early without having to work extra time later on to fix any issues that come up.
2. No. I would use E2E to test more of how the user would work through the website, i.e. more user experience than checking to see if a function returns the correct output.
3. No. The reason being that most likely the messaging feature will require more than one function, i.e. multiple moving parts, thus using unit testing would not be the ideal testing environment. However, testing each individual component of the messaging feature would fall under unit testing.
4. Yes. I would test this with unit testing. This would be an easier and more ideal scenario for unit testing since unit testing is meant to test on a small scale, and testing only the max length is a small portion of the whole messaging feature.
